<p>This is where our graduate research group will be posting any research related to our post-quantum analysis of TLS and SSL. In this blog we will be looking into various topics including post-quantum signatures, effects of quantum computing on TLS, benefits of switching to post-quantum algorithms, benefits of some post-quantum algorithms over others, and whatever other topics come up.</p>

<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>Collin and I are interested in post-quantum because of its relatively recent prominence in the computing world and the potentially drastic effects that it could have on the internet (more specifically secure connections through TLS and SSL).</p>

<p>We want to analyze a number of different algorithms that protect against post-quantum attacks and weigh the benefits and negatives of each in order to get a better grasp on the potential future of TLS. Our general purpose is going to be to determine how the TLS community can best protect against future quantum attacks and offer possible alternatives and options for such protection. </p>

<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h2>

<p>A description of what you are planning to do (this doesnâ€™t need a lot of detail now, but should be enough for readers to understand your plans). </p>

<p>At the moment, we are planning to look at a number of different post-quantum capable algorithms and look at their costs for time, space, and security to weigh these algorithms against one another. We will be specifically looking into how TLS connections will be affected in each case as well as in the case that none of these changes are put into effect, with the worst possible case being completely broken TLS connections from quantum-attack. </p>
